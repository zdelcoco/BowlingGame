# BowlingGame
After watching Uncle Bob's video on TDD (test driven development), I decided to recreate the bowling game in OpenEdge ABL.

Open a workspace in PDSOE and import BowlingGame and TestBowlingGame as projects 
  1. File > Import > General > Existing projects into workspace
  2. In the "Select root directory" field, point to your directory that contains the downloaded BowlingGame and TestBowlingGame folders
